    /// <summary>
    /// Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
    /// the IAM policy for an existing Yandex Resource Manager folder.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** This resource _must not_ be used in conjunction with
    ///    `yandex.ResourcemanagerFolderIamPolicy` or they will conflict over what your policy should be. Similarly, roles controlled by `yandex.ResourcemanagerFolderIamBinding`
    ///    should not be assigned using `yandex.ResourcemanagerFolderIamMember`.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Yandex = Pulumi.Yandex;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var department1 = Output.Create(Yandex.GetResourcemanagerFolder.InvokeAsync(new Yandex.GetResourcemanagerFolderArgs
    ///         {
    ///             FolderId = "some_folder_id",
    ///         }));
    ///         var admin = new Yandex.ResourcemanagerFolderIamMember("admin", new Yandex.ResourcemanagerFolderIamMemberArgs
    ///         {
    ///             FolderId = data.Yandex_resourcemanager.Department1.Name,
    ///             Member = "userAccount:user_id",
    ///             Role = "editor",
    ///         });
    ///     }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account. This member resource can be imported using the `folder id`, role, and account, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import yandex:index/resourcemanagerFolderIamMember:ResourcemanagerFolderIamMember my_project "folder_id viewer foo@example.com"
    /// ```
